# HumanPoseEstimationsusing-ArtificialIntelligence
Human Pose Estimation (HPE) uses AI to detect key body points (like joints) from images or videos. It tracks posture and movement for applications in healthcare, sports, AR, security, and robotics. Using deep learning models like OpenPose, it estimates body pose in real-time with high accuracy.
